# QPSK-Simulation
MATLAB assignment to simulate the performance of a conventional QPSK and a QPSK Direct Sequence-Spread Spectrum System(DS-SSS).

Task 1 is a simulation without noise, while tasks 2-5 simulate the system in the presence of noise.
In task 6, jamming interference is added to the system.
In task 7, the system is converted into a SSS, with both noise and jamming interference present.
